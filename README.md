Language - it's the language I find the easiest to use
frameworks:
- selenium, already has lots of build in features for browser manipulation, it's open source and very easy to configure and use.
-Junity, is responsible for performing the tests
Project Structure - Maven, as it removes the complexity of import and management of the dependency libraries.


INSTRUCTIONS:
